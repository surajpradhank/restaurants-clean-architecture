Unit Test Cases

To test a class with an internal access modifier, we can either change its access to public (though this is generally not recommended) or make use of the 'InternalsVisibleTo' attribute in the assembly to allow access to the internal members from the test project."

The key word here is 'InternalsVisibleTo' attribute, which allows access without modifying access levels directly.
Ex - [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Restaurants.Infrastructure.Tests")]
